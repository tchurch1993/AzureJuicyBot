A staring contest? I never lose.
Are you looking at my ass?
Bullets do not grow on perennial woody plants.
"Can I help you, Reclaimer?"
Direct your fire elsewhere!
Do you mind?
Do you think bullets grow on trees?
"I am not the enemy, Reclaimer."
I don't blink.
I'm quite impervious.
I've got you in my crosshairs.
Is my hat on crooked?
"Is there some problem, Reclaimer?"
Is there something in my eye?
May I be of some assistance to you?
May I be of some assistance?
"Must you, really?"
My ideas never stop coming.
MY shields don't deplete.
"Oddly enough, it sounds as if I have a tongue."
Oh! You're a klutz.
"Oh, I see - you're a moron!"
"Oh, I see... you're clumsy."
Please - do try to be more careful.
"Please, desist."
Be careful!
Do you require aid?
I am ready to fight.
I'm prepared for war.
Save your anger for our true foes!
Unworthy of my blades.
What do you mean?
What is it you want?
"Yes, what is it?"
Yes?
You dare challenge me?
You should not try my patience.
"A gift, for you!"
Advance! A sniper - find cover!
After it! It cannot escape!
Ahhh - it's a good day!
Away!
Bastard!
Change your panties and flush it out!
Come and fight me!
Cover me! you're covered!
Cowardly traitor!
"Damn you, you bastard!"
Demon - your life is forfeit.
"Die, traitor!"
"Don't break ranks, pack brothers!"
Everyone - grenades!
Found him!
He may be nearby - stay alert!
He was my lover!
Here it is!
I am wounded - I bleed!
I had him - he's in cover.
I hate you!
I have found my dinner!
I smelled it out!
I would drink your blood!
I'm losing it! I just wanna be home!
I'm scared - and there's nothing I can do to help!
We still have geothermal power to some of these facilities.
A fearsome weapon!
"A fine battle, don't you think?"
Aahh huh?
Advance!
Aha! I destroyed that one!
Aieee!
Aiiee!
"Another day, another victory!"
Are they done?
Are you blind?
Are you ill?
Can I assist you with something?
Can you not see?
Come on... really!
Did you think to best an elite?
Didn't I give you this for Christmas?
Do I look like an Unggoy?
Do you want something?
"Don't be a fool, reclaimer!"
Don't point that thing at me!
Don't you have more pressing matters to attend to?
"Focus your rage on the prophets, and their lackeys!"
Follow his lead!
Foolish wretch!
Are you looking at me because I'm pretty... or because you enjoy being slapped?
But I just found the sweet spot on that one!
"Cool your jets, buddy. You're not my type."
"Could you, um... stop it?"
"Could you, um... STOP IT?"
Did you see me kick that guy's ass?
"Dude, stop staring. There's no party going on in my pants."
"Gosh - let's be friends forever! K, thanks, bye!"
Hahaha - I wish they all were that easy.
"Hey - if you're just gonna stand there, why don't you go get me some whiskey?"
"Hey - keep your eyes in the green zone, soldier!"
Hey - you awake in that helmet?
"Hey soldier - reserve the PDA for your momma, huh?"
Hey! Now I got brains on my face!
Hey! Why don't you just take my pants while you're at it?
"Hey! You're making me uncomfortable, okay?"
Hey... I've got an idea... let's go shoot some aliens!
How long were you in cryo?
"I am not THAT good-looking, okay?"
I don't have the body armor for one more of those.
I guess I should be glad that you didn't kill me.
I have pictures on MySpace. Go check those out!
"I know, right? I look cute in this!"
I'm gonna stomp a mudhole in your ass!
I'm revved up and ready to rock.
I shall rise again.
Let us begin!
A holy flare to light the journey!
Ah - we're doomed!
"Ah, no, he's not here!"
Air-sucking windbag fleshy!
Always in the last place you look.
"At this point, if the Demon kill us... we deserve it."
Attack!
Bad guy!
Bad guy! Twelve o'clock!
Big bastard!
Bullying heretic!
By your command!
Come back when you're ready to fight!
Comin' for ya!
"Darn, he got away!"
Death from the sky!
Death is coming.
"Demon, you're weak!"
Don't irritate the demon!
Don't just stand there cowering... fight!
Don't kill me!
Don't make him any angrier!
Don't make the demon angry!
Don't run after him - it's got germs.
Don't worry! I'll get him!
...the gorram-hell do I do with this?
A-ow - my freakin' buttcheek!
Advance - on the double!
"Ah, relax, relax. That one will have a heart attack, in about a minute."
"Ah, that was just an hors d'oeuvres - bring on the steak!"
"Ah, we'll get him later."
"Ah, you're doing just shiny!"
"All right, officially, now, you're stalking me."
"All right, Waldo - I've found you."
All right... and now it's officially creepy.
Am I still alive? Really? It's just... I can't tell.
"And, uh... and so we basically keep doing this until there are none of them left, huh?"
Another victory for ODST superiority!
Anyone home? No? Good.
"Anything I can do, Chief?"
"Are we gonna have some kind of problem, Creepy?"
"Are we playing the silent game cause I'm not good at that game! Oh! I - ah, I lost."
"Are you checking to see if I have a Flood infection? Because I don't, it's... eczema."
Are you trying to hypnotize me or something?
Assface!
"Aw, c'mon, guys!"
"Aw, great - there's more!"
"Aw, I'm gonna take some heads with this!"
Bastard!
Beats my standard-issue noisemaker!
" The Chief! Oh, crikey, now what do we do?"
"Ah, yeah. Great stuff!"
"C'mon, guys!"
"Crikey - what are you, a bunch of schoolgirls? Hahaha - Girl Scouts!"
Grenade!
"Hey - take a picture, it lasts longer."
"Hey, nice throw!"
Let's motivate!
Oh - thank god you're here!
"What are ya, a bunch of schoolgirls?"
"Wow, we just basically reamed 'em, huh?"
Assault!
Capture the flag.
Game over!
Hill moved.
Infected!
Juggernaut.
King of the hill.
New juggernaut.
New VIP.
Oddball.
Play ball!
Slayer.
Territories.
'Bout time I had the upper hand!
A plan would be good.
"Ah, nice pause, but um... this war ain't gonna fight itself."
Are you waiting for me to do something?
"Boy, I just love getting up in the morning and kicking somebody's ass."
"Boy, the uglier they are, the harder they fall."
C'mon - let's light this candle.
"C'mon, let's do this thing!"
"Can we get our act together, before we, you know, do that again?"
Can you hit anything with this?
"Chief, there's nothing happening here now."
Did you go somewhere? And why didn't you bring back two?
"Didn't work so good for you, why would I want it?"
"Does it look like I'm complaining, sir?"
"Don't ask, don't tell."
"Hey, any time you want this back... too bad!"
"Hey, Chief - thanks."
I better not find that laying around somewhere!
I do not like the idea of dying. Just wanna let you know.
I guess it's yours now!
I guess you know what you're doing.
"I know I'm quite a sight, but do your looking later!"
I love takin' down brutes.
"I thought I was gonna buy the farm back there, I did I did I did..."
"I'm in your debt, sir."
A staring contest? I never lose.

I love takin' down brutes.
"I thought I was gonna buy the farm back there, I did I did I did..."
"I'm in your debt, sir."
And those who made the rings? What happened to the Forerunners?
By the Prophets! What have these brutes done?
Oracle - what is Halo's purpose?
Tartarus - stop!
The cable - I'm going to cut it. Get everyone back to the ships.
The sacred rings - what are they?
Then we shall force him out.
What would you have your arbiter do?
brutes
Snippet
 Thinking about running?
A day's rations says I do this in one cut.
A hunter must be patient.
A killing ground.
A tiny morsel... not worth the hunt!
"A true hunter shows his flesh, Demon!"
Air's too thin to hold the scent.
An elusive quarry.
An illusive glory.
An unsuccessful hunt.
Barely a prick!
Bastard Elite...
Bastard!
"Boil in your pot, demon!"
Can you see it?
Can you track it?
Can't be this way!
Canned meat!
Careful! Grenade!
"Careful! It may try to double back! Next time, we will catch it."
Careful! It might have friends.
Come at him from all sides!
Come back! We won't hurt you.
Come close - I don't bite. Hahaha!
Come out! There is no time for these games!
Permission to leave the station.
To give the Covenant back their bomb.
"After that stunt on the Cairo, I KNOW you're not afraid of heights."
And people say I've got a big head.
"Apparently, these are the Prophet Heirarchs' private quarters - their inner sanctum."
"Ask yourself this question: Is what I'm doing right now helping Cortana keep this station from blowing into tiny, tiny bits?"
Chief - leave me!
"Chief, come to the lower level. More guards, get ready."
"Chief, you're going to have to board the Scarab."
Chief. We don't have much time.
"Come to the middle level, Chief. The marines are just inside. Careful of the guards."
"Fine, I won't watch. Meet you at the bottom, okay?"
Forget about the flood - you've got to get aboard!
Good. The bridge is down. Now about those wraiths...
Great Journey? Doesn't he know what these rings do?
"Here, Chief, jump in!"
"His throne is shielded - it's deflecting everything you throw at it! Get in close, and do whatever you can."
"Hold here until the pelican arrives, Chief."
I am your shield. I am your sword. [From Halo 3 Trailer]
I can't go with you!
I have defied gods and demons. [From Halo 3 Trailer]
"I have to stay here, Chief!"
"I knew the Covenant was good at repurposing Forerunner technology, but this is amazing! They've been using the Forerunner ship's engines as an energy source for the city. The ship isn't so much launching as it is disengaging, uncoupling itself from High Charity's power grid. Stopping Truth - that's all that matters!"
"I know you - your past, your future... [From Halo 3 Trailer]"
I saw it too. It looked like a temple. If I were a megalomaniac (and I'm not) that's where I'd be.
I wish I had time to decipher these inscriptions. The Forerunners revered this place - that much is clear. But was it a temple? A university? I can't say.
"I'll do what I can to slow the launch sequence. There's something inside the ship... a presence - it's fighting back! For a Covenant construct, it's unusually formidable."
Advance on it! You first!
Cover me! All set - go!
Do it. You first!
"How did you fare? Well, as expected."
How went the battle? Fine! You?
I forbid you. I will not do nothing!
You - go take a look! No way - you do!
You shall not - Honor demands it!
You! Go look! Right away!
"A fine battle, don't you think?"
A head your size cannot contain much brain.
"A pox on you, beast!"
A zealot? So much for a stealthy advance.
And yet I live!
Another here!
"Another misstep, Arbiter, and it will be the end for you."
Arbiter - take your pick.
"Arbiter! Generally speaking, friends are blue."
Are there any more?
Are you blind?
Are you injured?
As if you could ever take our place!
"Away we go, brothers!"
Back off!
"Before you die, you shall know fear!"
Beg! Beg on your knees!
Beware! Snipers!
Brother down!
"By the Forerunners, no!"
By the prophets!
By the ring!
"By the rings, this is too much!"
Call out targets as you see them.
"Calm yourself, Arbiter!"
"A pox on you, beast!"
A righteous anger!
Abhorrent beast!
Abomination!
Agony!
An enemy!
"Another day, another victory."
Another for me!
Any more?
Apostate! Your end is nigh.
Arbiter - leave me my share!
Arbiter - so glad you could join us.
"Arbiter or no, he must be stopped!"
Arbiter! Save some for the rest of us.
Arbiter! We have little time!
"Arbiter, you are my hero."
Arbiter... you ill?
Are we not the mightiest force in the galaxy?
Are you blind?
"Are you comfortable, Arbiter?"
Are you sure?
Asshole.
Backstabbing Arbiter!
Bad Arbiter!
Bah - over so soon?
Do not look! Me own boss!
Go check if there! Isn't here!
"How you doing? A few minor annoyances, that is all."
How you? Fine! You?
Keep me safe? Me got ya!
Let's go! Me with you!
Let's run away! You not boss of me...
Me have bad feeling about this. You always have bad feeling! You had bad feeling about morning food nipple!
"No, stay here! Mind own business!"
Stay back! You not boss of me.
That very bad idea... Mind own business!
Yeah? Bring it. Bring it!
Yow!
Ach - killjoy!
After all me do for you?
Aha! Find you!
Ahh! What?
Air breather!
All set - go!
Always hated you elites!
Another enemy!
Arbiter kill us all! Hahahaha!
Arbiter our savior! Stupid jackal... say thank you!
Arbiter promise to be good?
Arbiter!
Arbiter? Tell me a story.
Arbiter? We be friends?
Are you crazy? Quiet!
"Aw, come on!"
Bad Arbiter!
Bad friend!
Be careful!
Big... scary... thing! Run away!
Boaster!
Bringer of death!
But... Arbiter friend!
But... Arbiter friend! No! Nobody like YOU! Except for Arbiter - he like me!
Can't all just get along?
 You lucky me have poor short-term memory!
Aahhh!
"Ahh, okay."
As expected!
Away! Run away!
Baboons go down easy! Good one!
Be better?
"Be still, me beating heart."
Better than expected...
Better to let it go.
Big bad thing!
Could have been worse!
Danger on way!
Demon feel stupid when me kill it!
Demon helmet make great backpack!
Don't worry. Me already resigned to early death.
Enemy up there!
Even me know that stupid!
Every grunt for self!
Evil bad demon!
Evil bad demon.
Fight is this way!
For me?
Frankly me rather not.
Give room!
"Come on, son - step into the red square."
"Get the hell out of my armory, Split lip! Aaaugh! Dang it!"
Go ahead and stand in the red square. It'll just take a minute.
Hit the switch! It wont hurt... much.
"I know you Spartans think you know everything, but it couldn't hurt you to at least look this way."
"Look, just cause the brass kisses your ass, don't mean I will. Look at me when I talk to you!"
You have to stand in the red square before we can start the test.
Hahaha... get in line.
I wondered who the prophets would send to silence me. An Arbiter... I'm flattered.
"This will save me from the storm, but you will be consumed."
"Aaah, knocked off again (with 'down' overdub) [original reversed; multiple versions included]"
Blown away! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
"Dead everywhere, yay! [original reversed; multiple versions included]"
Give a shit [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Hey - not that guy! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
I need to wee. [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Not again! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Not clean - wash yourself. [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Shot ya! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
That's a victory! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
"Yeah, yeah, none other. [original reversed; multiple versions included]"
 I didn't sign up for this!
After all we've been through together?
"All right, you just showed us how NOT to do it!"
Another bastard - right there!
Aren't you enjoying your shore leave?
Ashes to ashes.
"At this rate, we're NEVER gonna win this war!"
"Aw, man, you ain't dead - get up!"
Bastards movin' up!
Boo! Ha! Two for flinching.
Boo! Hah! Two for flinching.
Bring the body over - I'll sign it!
Buggers! Headin' over the rooftops!
"C'mon, Arbiter! Kick that guy's ass!"
"C'mon, boy... you could become a man today!"
"C'mon, Chief - get up! You've had worse..."
"C'mon, Chief - they're ready for us on the bridge."
Cakehole - shut it!
Cancel Christmas!
Careful - he's got father issues he hasn't worked through!
Careful! Not everyone has fancy-ass power armor!
"Clean your visor, jackass!"
"Come on, Chief!"
"Come over here, you big lug! Hahahahahaha..."
Cortana! What in the hell is going on?
Are you TRYING to kill me?
Check your targets!
"Chief, c'mon... get to work!"
"Hey, watch it!"
I hope you're staring at my ribbons.
My father warned me about guys like you! Actually... he mentioned you specifically.
"Thanks, Chief. I owe you one."
"Fall in over here! Yeah, you got it. Will there be snacks?"
I don't want to kill you... it's just you're too ugly to let live. Hey - mind if I use that one?
I think I'm gonna need a medic. So how we doin' over there? Doin' my job...
"If you forget about the Covenant, and the fact that we're stuck on a freaky alien world it's actually...kinda fun!"
"Oh, man, I love the beach. I hope you packed a suit, mate!"
Thats a bad idea. Hey - I'll decide what's right for this guy.
"They're in standard formation - little bastards up front, big ones in back. [Scripted Cairo Station Dialogue]"
Why... what's wrong with it?
You're not the boss of me!
[Howard Dean scream]
Affirmative.
Backing you up...
Good one!
If I find out that you have x-ray vision... you're dead.
Okay Chief!
Push 'em back!
Sniper neutralized.
The last guy that looked at me like that? I kicked him right in the nuts.
To hell with you!
"What do you need, Chief?"
What... is the poor monster frightened?
Wow... ugly AND stupid. What a combo!
"Yes, sir."
Ah! Greased 'em!
"Ah! This never gets old, mate!"
"Ah, piece of piss, sir."
"Ah, you little buggers make it too easy!"
"Ah, you little buggers make me sick."
"Aha! I didn't even break a sweat, pig!"
And I thought I was good behind the wheel!
Another kill for me! Hah!
"Aw, man, he is SO dead."
"Bloody hell - what's this, then?"
"Bloody hell! What's this, then?"
"Bloody hell, Cortana - shut him off!"
C'mon - let's give him some help!
Chief! Same team! [variant]
Chief! What the hell are you doing?
"Come on, fellas - into the fight!"
"Come on, get up, you're not hurt."
"Come on, mate - after me!"
Contact!
Dammit - I've never felt pain like this before!
"Don't piss me off, mate!"
Down for the count!
Enemy spotted!
"Enemy's over there, Chief!"
Eyes on!
A Spartan! Kick-ass.
Adrian!
Advantage... us.
All right - aim for their asses!
All right - follow your nose.
All right - now we're good!
All right - who pissed them off?
All right then - that's yours.
All right! I think we officially won!
All right! Problem taken care of - I'm hungry.
"All right, everybody - take five!"
"All right, everybody - take five! No - sorry, Chief, not you."
"All right, I'm outta here. You've got a problem, man."
"All right, let's find a nose, and follow it!"
"All right, what do you want? A cookie?"
And everybody was kung fu fighting...
And we've got a lovely parting gift for the losers. It's death!
And... how is THAT smart?
And... what can I do you for?
Are you hiding? You're adorable.
Are you made of leprechauns? Cause that was awesome.
Bam! Spice that up a count.
Bam! Spice that up a notch.
Big Mo - let's make it happen!
By the way... this war thing? Totally sucks.
"'kay, don't shoot his head, you're gonna hurt Cortana. She's a hottie. She's blue... but she's a hottie."
A la tres! [On three!]
"Ah, man! 1"
"Ah, man! 2"
"Ah, man! 3"
Ai!
"Almost gave me a heart attack, sir!"
And that goes for me too!
Aw man- c'mon!
"Bet they feel stupid, sir!"
C'mon. Let's roll.
Chase 'em down! Rub 'em out!
Check it - that's the new armor!
Chief? We're gonna hang here.
"Cleaned her this morning, Chief. (People was watching, too.)"
"Come on, maricon - hahahaha! Woohoo!"
Damn four foot nothing!
Damn four-foot nothing!
death scream variant]
"Did you see how high he went, muchacho?"
Do I look scared?
Don't shoot his head - you'll hurt Cortana!
"Don't stop shooting, sir!"
Don't worry - Hell don't have a height requirement! Hahahah...
Elite my ass! Is that the best you can do?
"All together, okay?"
And the crowd goes wild!
Are you trying to get killed?
"C'mon, Chief - give me a break!"
Didn't even break a sweat!
Don't bother gettin' up.
Eyes downrange - NOT down shirt!
Friendly down! Friendly down!
Get over here! I need a new pair of boots!
Glad I packed extra ammo.
Glad I packed extra ammo.
"Good thing you don't have far to fall, huh?"
Got another one over here!
Hey - piggy! Even I'm taller than you!
I bleed more than that on a regular basis.
I think you need a time out.
"I'll make you proud, sir."
I'm ready.
I've had tougher cramps.
If you call this flirting you've got a lot to learn.
It's been real.
It's tight quarters on the other side sir. Use this.
"Look good, feel good..."
"My body armor works fine, thank you."
My hero!
About as good as usual... so really... not so good.
All I do is give give give.
And they call ME an idiot?
Are you all right?
Away we go!
Battle ready!
Be careful! Ooo!
"Before you got here, Chief, I never thought I'd make it out of this alive."
Better'n standing here by myself!
"Can I help you, Chief?"
"Can I open my eyes now, sir?"
"Can I please have that back, sir?"
Can you check that out?
"Can you sign it, sir? I'm a huge fan."
Chief - could you kill all those things? That would really be awesome.
Chief - you gonna let him say that about your mother?
Chief and I are gonna make you hurt!
Chief! Same team!
"Chief, I'm scared enough as it is."
"Chief, please! Don't stop firing!"
"Come get me! I'm just a little coward! No, really, I am. Hahahah..."
Enjoy it while it lasts!
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Found one! Help!
"Give up, why don't you?"
Another contact!
Any time you want me to drive... just say the word.
Are you trying to get on my good side?
Barrel is hot. Watch your hands.
"Chalk another one up, boys."
Chief - work the flanks!
Chief... don't do that again.
Clean your damn visor!
Come on - stick your head out... please?
"Come on, Chief - let's do this!"
Creepy little runt!
Do i have to steal your gun?
Do those things even understand what you're saying?
Don't be shy - let's dance!
Dropped it!
Enemy down!
Fair enough.
Gimme back my bullets - I'll use 'em on something important.
Go on... take a good look. Now move out!
Good thing I like my job!
"Good, Chief!"
Got another hostile!
Got it!
"Grow up, kid."
Guess you got your reasons.
"[master chief death yell, a la Dr. Strangelove]"
Are you listening to me?
"C'mon now! Is that a weapon or a fla - oh, god! Aaauugh!"
Careful! You'll tear a tendon doing that.
Chief - stand in the red square.
"Fine, but don't come crying to me when you rip your leg out of its socket."
"Go ahead and look at the top light, Chief!"
Hey - take it easy!
"I know you Spartans think you know everything, but it couldn't hurt you to at least LOOK this way."
"I'm talking to you, Chief. Look at me!"
It's considered respectful to look at someone when they're talking.
"Look at the bottom light, son."
"Look, just cause the brass kisses your ass, don't mean I will... Look at me when I talk to you!"
"Over here, Chief. Focus!"
"Step into the red square, Chief, and we'll get started."
This is important - you could at least look at me while I explain it!
Chief! Get inside - gear up. We're taking this fight to the surface.
"After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings. They, and all additional sentient life in three radii of the galactic center, died, as planned. Would you like to see the relevant data?"
Apology. Protocol does not allow me to interfere with any aspect of the sequence.
Charging sequence initiated. Primary generators coming online.
Please - use caution! This reclaimer is delicate.
"Power generation phase complete. The installation is ready to fire. Starting final countdown... and may I say, Reclaimers, it has been a pleasure to serve you both. Goodbye!"
Secondary generators charging. All systems are performing well within operational parameters.
"Under more controlled circumstances, I would suggest the Reclaimer simply remove the index."
"Weapons of last resort, built by the Forerunners to eliminate potential Flood hosts, thereby rendering the parasite harmless."
Assault.
Ball taken.
Betrayal!
Betrayed!
Bomb armed! Bomb planted!
Bomb dropped!
Bomb returned!
Capture the flag.
Defense.
Double kill!
Flag captured.
Flag returned!
Gained the lead.
Game over.
Hill contested!
Hill controlled!
Hill moved.
In the zone!
Juggernaut.
Killfrenzy.
Killimanjaro.
Killtacular!
Killtrocity!
King of the hill.
Lost the lead!
Are my guards too much for you?
"Every member of the Covenant shall walk the path; none will be left behind when our Great Journey begins! That is the Prophets' age-old promise, and it shall be fulfilled! Great Journey? Doesn't he know what these rings do?"
Fool! You've made yourself an easy target.
Guards! Remove this vermin from my sight.
"Here I am, human - slay me if you can!"
Human filth! You foul this holy place.
"I shall light this holy ring, release its cleansing flame, and burn a path into the divine beyond!"
"In a gesture of peace and reconciliation, the Prophets promised to find the means of the Forerunners' transcendence, and to share this knowledge with the Elites. The Elites promised to defend the Prophets as they searched. A simple arrangement... that has become our binding Covenant. Transcendence, huh? More like mass suicide."
Incompetents! I'll kill it myself!
"Most of those we encountered on our search were compelled to join our union, to take part in a movement that promised freedom for allegiance, salvation for service! But some, like the humans, chose to impede our progress, block our access to sacred sites, damage holy relics! For their transgressions, the humans shall be hunted until none remain alive!"
Surely you can do better than that!
"The Forerunners, our most exalted lords, used the seven sacred rings to flee a doomed existence, to escape their endless struggle against the flood. Long ago, the Prophets and Elites fought an equally fruitless war. Indeed, I suspect we would still be at each other's throats had the Prophets not found evidence of the Forerunners and their Great Journey."
The Great Journey will not be postponed!
This is the human's greatest warrior? Hahahahaha!
Warriors! Attack! The demon must die!
Why anyone would fear this 'demon' is beyond me.
You dare to interrupt my sermon?
"You shall not hide from me, Demon."
"Your very existence offends me, Demon!"
[Regret death sounds]
A little confusing... but effective.
Affirmative.
Aim... somewhere else!
All set!
All your dogs are not barkin' at the same tree.
All's clear.
Almost funny... try again!
"Always liked you, Chief. Always liked you!"
And to think I volunteered for this.
"And what, pray tell, am I supposed to do with this?"
Another alien! Over there!
Any time!
Are we finished?
"Are you mentally handicapped, sir?"
Are you TRYING to make me angry?
"As long as we standin' here, might as well write my old lady."
"Aside from all this nasty stuff whizzing past my head, I'm fine."
"Aw, poor thing!"
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do? You're gonna get the crap kicked outta ya - that's what you're gonna do.
Boogey-man at one o'clock!
"Check your target, sir!"
Chief - feel free to get in on this.
"Chief, I thought we was like, partners, and whatnot."
"Chief, we go back, you know... like flapjacks and collard greens."
"Chief, you may be the dumbest best man I've ever met."
Aim more carefully!
"All right, then - I'll show you how it's done."
Arbiter - speak your mind.
Arbiter - you give me no choice!
Arbiter! What are you doing?
Arbiter... you have my thanks.
"Careful, Arbiter!"
Charge the enemy!
"Come out, so we may kill you!"
"Come, Arbiter - what foolishness is this?"
"Control yourself, Arbiter!"
Fair enough!
Follow me to victory!
Good.
Have your brains leaked from your skull?
He's using a holodrone - he must be close.
Here I am!
I have it right here!
I stand ready.
I stare at you - you stare at me. I fail to see the point.
"I welcome that, and more!"
"I wonder who the sniper will shoot first... you, or me."
I'll assume that was an accident!
I'll put it to good use!
"I'm in your debt, Arbiter."
'Least you breathed. I was worried.
A plan is a beautiful thing when it works. This was a beautiful thing.
A victory ain't the war... but it sure tastes good.
A-hole!
"According to the manual, you're a jackass!"
"After I bury them, I'm gonna bury you."
Ah - some days it don't pay to get out of bed!
"Ah, it's long gone - no heat!"
"Ah, save it for the next one."
Ain't nothin' permanent.
All right - I need help!
All right - let's get medieval on their ass!
All right - let's keep it wired tight! This ain't a party!
"All right - let's make 'em see-through, people!"
All right - not all of 'em are gonna be this easy.
All right - vehicle destroyed!
All right - zip it!
"All right people, let's keep it wired tight."
All right! Saddle up! We're movin' out!
"All right, gentlemen - let's get freaky!"
"All right, I admit it... ooh, that hurt."
"All right, let's buckle up."
"All right, let's load up the butcher shop, people!"
"All right, let's not get happy."
"All right, let's rock and roll, people."
Dawa ya moto ni moto.

It's nothing compared to what I'll do to you.
Just like the rest of your kind - you're cowardly and weak!
Not another word!
"One more word, Oracle, and I'll rip your eye from its socket!"
"Put it down, and disobey the heirarchs?"
"Take care, Arbiter. What you say is heresy!"
What? Is the mighty Arbiter afraid?

The parasite did not defeat the Forerunners - and it shall not defeat us!
And those who made the rings? What happened to the Forerunners?
By the Prophets! What have these brutes done?
Oracle - what is Halo's purpose?
Tartarus - stop!
The cable - I'm going to cut it. Get everyone back to the ships.
The sacred rings - what are they?
Then we shall force him out.
What would you have your arbiter do?
 Thinking about running?
A day's rations says I do this in one cut.
A hunter must be patient.
A killing ground.
A tiny morsel... not worth the hunt!
"A true hunter shows his flesh, Demon!"
Air's too thin to hold the scent.
An elusive quarry.
An illusive glory.
An unsuccessful hunt.
Barely a prick!
Bastard Elite...
Bastard!

Can you see it?
Can you track it?
Can't be this way!

Careful! Grenade!
"Careful! It may try to double back! Next time, we will catch it."
Careful! It might have friends.
Come at him from all sides!
Come back! We won't hurt you.
Come close - I don't bite. Hahaha!
Come out! There is no time for these games!
Permission to leave the station.
To give the Covenant back their bomb.
"After that stunt on the Cairo, I KNOW you're not afraid of heights."
And people say I've got a big head.
"Apparently, these are the Prophet Heirarchs' private quarters - their inner sanctum."
"Ask yourself this question: Is what I'm doing right now helping Cortana keep this station from blowing into tiny, tiny bits?"
Chief - leave me!
"Chief, come to the lower level. More guards, get ready."
"Chief, you're going to have to board the Scarab."
Chief. We don't have much time.
"Come to the middle level, Chief. The marines are just inside. Careful of the guards."
"Fine, I won't watch. Meet you at the bottom, okay?"
Forget about the flood - you've got to get aboard!
Good. The bridge is down. Now about those wraiths...
Great Journey? Doesn't he know what these rings do?
"Here, Chief, jump in!"
"His throne is shielded - it's deflecting everything you throw at it! Get in close, and do whatever you can."
"Hold here until the pelican arrives, Chief."
I am your shield. I am your sword. [From Halo 3 Trailer]
I can't go with you!
I have defied gods and demons. [From Halo 3 Trailer]
"I have to stay here, Chief!"
"I knew the Covenant was good at repurposing Forerunner technology, but this is amazing! They've been using the Forerunner ship's engines as an energy source for the city. The ship isn't so much launching as it is disengaging, uncoupling itself from High Charity's power grid. Stopping Truth - that's all that matters!"
"I know you - your past, your future... [From Halo 3 Trailer]"
I saw it too. It looked like a temple. If I were a megalomaniac (and I'm not) that's where I'd be.
I wish I had time to decipher these inscriptions. The Forerunners revered this place - that much is clear. But was it a temple? A university? I can't say.
"I'll do what I can to slow the launch sequence. There's something inside the ship... a presence - it's fighting back! For a Covenant construct, it's unusually formidable."
Advance on it! You first!
Cover me! All set - go!
Do it. You first!
"How did you fare? Well, as expected."
How went the battle? Fine! You?
I forbid you. I will not do nothing!
You - go take a look! No way - you do!
You shall not - Honor demands it!
You! Go look! Right away!
"A fine battle, don't you think?"
A head your size cannot contain much brain.
"A pox on you, beast!"
A zealot? So much for a stealthy advance.
And yet I live!
Another here!
"Another misstep, Arbiter, and it will be the end for you."
Arbiter - take your pick.
"Arbiter! Generally speaking, friends are blue."
Are there any more?
Are you blind?
Are you injured?
As if you could ever take our place!
"Away we go, brothers!"
Back off!
"Before you die, you shall know fear!"
Beg! Beg on your knees!
Beware! Snipers!
Brother down!
"By the Forerunners, no!"
By the prophets!
By the ring!
"By the rings, this is too much!"
Call out targets as you see them.
"Calm yourself, Arbiter!"
"A pox on you, beast!"
A righteous anger!
Abhorrent beast!
Abomination!
Agony!
An enemy!
"Another day, another victory."
Another for me!
Any more?
Apostate! Your end is nigh.
Arbiter - leave me my share!
Arbiter - so glad you could join us.
"Arbiter or no, he must be stopped!"
Arbiter! Save some for the rest of us.
Arbiter! We have little time!

How you? Fine! You?
Keep me safe? Me got ya!
Let's go! Me with you!
Let's run away! You not boss of me...
Me have bad feeling about this. You always have bad feeling! You had bad feeling about morning food nipple!
"No, stay here! Mind own business!"
Stay back! You not boss of me.
That very bad idea... Mind own business!
Yeah? Bring it. Bring it!
Yow!
Ach - killjoy!
After all me do for you?
Aha! Find you!
Ahh! What?
Air breather!
All set - go!
Always hated you elites!
Another enemy!
Arbiter kill us all! Hahahaha!
Arbiter our savior! Stupid jackal... say thank you!
Arbiter promise to be good?
Arbiter!
Arbiter? Tell me a story.

Can't all just get along?
 You lucky me have poor short-term memory!
Aahhh!
"Ahh, okay."
As expected!
Away! Run away!
Baboons go down easy! Good one!
Be better?
"Be still, me beating heart."
Better than expected...
Better to let it go.
Big bad thing!
Could have been worse!
Danger on way!
Demon feel stupid when me kill it!
Demon helmet make great backpack!
Don't worry. Me already resigned to early death.
Enemy up there!
Even me know that stupid!
Every grunt for self!
Evil bad demon!
Evil bad demon.
Fight is this way!
For me?
Frankly me rather not.
Give room!
"Come on, son - step into the red square."
"Get the hell out of my armory, Split lip! Aaaugh! Dang it!"
Go ahead and stand in the red square. It'll just take a minute.
Hit the switch! It wont hurt... much.
"I know you Spartans think you know everything, but it couldn't hurt you to at least look this way."
"Look, just cause the brass kisses your ass, don't mean I will. Look at me when I talk to you!"
You have to stand in the red square before we can start the test.
Hahaha... get in line.
I wondered who the prophets would send to silence me. An Arbiter... I'm flattered.
"This will save me from the storm, but you will be consumed."
"Aaah, knocked off again (with 'down' overdub) [original reversed; multiple versions included]"
Blown away! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
"Dead everywhere, yay! [original reversed; multiple versions included]"
Give a shit [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Hey - not that guy! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
I need to wee. [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Not again! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Not clean - wash yourself. [original reversed; multiple versions included]
Shot ya! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
That's a victory! [original reversed; multiple versions included]
"Yeah, yeah, none other. [original reversed; multiple versions included]"
 I didn't sign up for this!
After all we've been through together?
"All right, you just showed us how NOT to do it!"
Another bastard - right there!
Aren't you enjoying your shore leave?
Ashes to ashes.
"At this rate, we're NEVER gonna win this war!"
"Aw, man, you ain't dead - get up!"
Bastards movin' up!
Boo! Ha! Two for flinching.
Boo! Hah! Two for flinching.
Bring the body over - I'll sign it!
Buggers! Headin' over the rooftops!
"C'mon, Arbiter! Kick that guy's ass!"
"C'mon, boy... you could become a man today!"
"C'mon, Chief - get up! You've had worse..."
"C'mon, Chief - they're ready for us on the bridge."
Cakehole - shut it!
Cancel Christmas!
Careful - he's got father issues he hasn't worked through!
Careful! Not everyone has fancy-ass power armor!
"Clean your visor, jackass!"
"Come on, Chief!"
"Come over here, you big lug! Hahahahahaha..."
Cortana! What in the hell is going on?
Are you TRYING to kill me?
Check your targets!
"Chief, c'mon... get to work!"
"Hey, watch it!"
I hope you're staring at my ribbons.
My father warned me about guys like you! Actually... he mentioned you specifically.
"Thanks, Chief. I owe you one."
"Fall in over here! Yeah, you got it. Will there be snacks?"
I don't want to kill you... it's just you're too ugly to let live. Hey - mind if I use that one?
I think I'm gonna need a medic. So how we doin' over there? Doin' my job...
"If you forget about the Covenant, and the fact that we're stuck on a freaky alien world it's actually...kinda fun!"
"Oh, man, I love the beach. I hope you packed a suit, mate!"
Thats a bad idea. Hey - I'll decide what's right for this guy.
"They're in standard formation - little bastards up front, big ones in back. [Scripted Cairo Station Dialogue]"
Why... what's wrong with it?
You're not the boss of me!
[Howard Dean scream]
Affirmative.
Backing you up...
Good one!
If I find out that you have x-ray vision... you're dead.
Okay Chief!
Push 'em back!
Sniper neutralized.
The last guy that looked at me like that? I kicked him right in the nuts.
To hell with you!
"What do you need, Chief?"
What... is the poor monster frightened?
Wow... ugly AND stupid. What a combo!
"Yes, sir."
Ah! Greased 'em!
"Ah! This never gets old, mate!"
"Ah, piece of piss, sir."
"Ah, you little buggers make it too easy!"
"Ah, you little buggers make me sick."
"Aha! I didn't even break a sweat, pig!"
And I thought I was good behind the wheel!
Another kill for me! Hah!
"Aw, man, he is SO dead."
"Bloody hell - what's this, then?"
"Bloody hell! What's this, then?"
"Bloody hell, Cortana - shut him off!"
C'mon - let's give him some help!
Chief! Same team! [variant]
Chief! What the hell are you doing?
"Come on, fellas - into the fight!"
"Come on, get up, you're not hurt."
"Come on, mate - after me!"
Contact!
Dammit - I've never felt pain like this before!
"Don't piss me off, mate!"
Down for the count!
Enemy spotted!
"Enemy's over there, Chief!"
Eyes on!
A Spartan! Kick-ass.
Adrian!
Advantage... us.
All right - aim for their asses!
All right - follow your nose.
All right - now we're good!
All right - who pissed them off?
All right then - that's yours.
All right! I think we officially won!
All right! Problem taken care of - I'm hungry.
"All right, everybody - take five!"
"All right, everybody - take five! No - sorry, Chief, not you."
"All right, I'm outta here. You've got a problem, man."
"All right, let's find a nose, and follow it!"
"All right, what do you want? A cookie?"
And everybody was kung fu fighting...
And we've got a lovely parting gift for the losers. It's death!
And... how is THAT smart?
And... what can I do you for?
Are you hiding? You're adorable.
Are you made of leprechauns? Cause that was awesome.
Bam! Spice that up a count.
Bam! Spice that up a notch.
Big Mo - let's make it happen!
By the way... this war thing? Totally sucks.
"'kay, don't shoot his head, you're gonna hurt Cortana. She's a hottie. She's blue... but she's a hottie."
A la tres! [On three!]
"Ah, man! 1"
"Ah, man! 2"
"Ah, man! 3"
Ai!
"Almost gave me a heart attack, sir!"
And that goes for me too!
Aw man- c'mon!
"Bet they feel stupid, sir!"
C'mon. Let's roll.
Chase 'em down! Rub 'em out!
Check it - that's the new armor!
Chief? We're gonna hang here.
"Cleaned her this morning, Chief. (People was watching, too.)"
"Come on, maricon - hahahaha! Woohoo!"
Damn four foot nothing!
Damn four-foot nothing!
death scream variant]
"Did you see how high he went, muchacho?"
Do I look scared?
Don't shoot his head - you'll hurt Cortana!
"Don't stop shooting, sir!"
Don't worry - Hell don't have a height requirement! Hahahah...
Elite my ass! Is that the best you can do?
"All together, okay?"
And the crowd goes wild!
Are you trying to get killed?
"C'mon, Chief - give me a break!"
Didn't even break a sweat!
Don't bother gettin' up.
Eyes downrange - NOT down shirt!
Friendly down! Friendly down!
Get over here! I need a new pair of boots!
Glad I packed extra ammo.
Glad I packed extra ammo.
"Good thing you don't have far to fall, huh?"
Got another one over here!
Hey - piggy! Even I'm taller than you!
I bleed more than that on a regular basis.
I think you need a time out.
"I'll make you proud, sir."
I'm ready.
I've had tougher cramps.
If you call this flirting you've got a lot to learn.
It's been real.
It's tight quarters on the other side sir. Use this.
"Look good, feel good..."
"My body armor works fine, thank you."
My hero!
About as good as usual... so really... not so good.
All I do is give give give.
And they call ME an idiot?
Are you all right?
Away we go!
Battle ready!
Be careful! Ooo!
"Before you got here, Chief, I never thought I'd make it out of this alive."
Better'n standing here by myself!
"Can I help you, Chief?"
"Can I open my eyes now, sir?"
"Can I please have that back, sir?"
Can you check that out?
"Can you sign it, sir? I'm a huge fan."
Chief - could you kill all those things? That would really be awesome.
Chief - you gonna let him say that about your mother?
Chief and I are gonna make you hurt!
Chief! Same team!
"Chief, I'm scared enough as it is."
"Chief, please! Don't stop firing!"
"Come get me! I'm just a little coward! No, really, I am. Hahahah..."
Enjoy it while it lasts!
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Found one! Help!
"Give up, why don't you?"
Another contact!
Any time you want me to drive... just say the word.
Are you trying to get on my good side?
Barrel is hot. Watch your hands.
"Chalk another one up, boys."
Chief - work the flanks!
Chief... don't do that again.
Clean your damn visor!
Come on - stick your head out... please?
"Come on, Chief - let's do this!"
Creepy little runt!
Do i have to steal your gun?
Do those things even understand what you're saying?
Don't be shy - let's dance!
Dropped it!
Enemy down!
Fair enough.
Gimme back my bullets - I'll use 'em on something important.
Go on... take a good look. Now move out!
Good thing I like my job!
"Good, Chief!"
Got another hostile!
Got it!
"Grow up, kid."
Guess you got your reasons.
"[master chief death yell, a la Dr. Strangelove]"
Are you listening to me?
"C'mon now! Is that a weapon or a fla - oh, god! Aaauugh!"
Careful! You'll tear a tendon doing that.
Chief - stand in the red square.
"Fine, but don't come crying to me when you rip your leg out of its socket."
"Go ahead and look at the top light, Chief!"
Hey - take it easy!
"I know you Spartans think you know everything, but it couldn't hurt you to at least LOOK this way."
"I'm talking to you, Chief. Look at me!"
It's considered respectful to look at someone when they're talking.
"Look at the bottom light, son."
"Look, just cause the brass kisses your ass, don't mean I will... Look at me when I talk to you!"
"Over here, Chief. Focus!"
"Step into the red square, Chief, and we'll get started."
This is important - you could at least look at me while I explain it!
Chief! Get inside - gear up. We're taking this fight to the surface.
"After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings. They, and all additional sentient life in three radii of the galactic center, died, as planned. Would you like to see the relevant data?"
Apology. Protocol does not allow me to interfere with any aspect of the sequence.
Charging sequence initiated. Primary generators coming online.
Please - use caution! This reclaimer is delicate.
"Power generation phase complete. The installation is ready to fire. Starting final countdown... and may I say, Reclaimers, it has been a pleasure to serve you both. Goodbye!"
Secondary generators charging. All systems are performing well within operational parameters.
"Under more controlled circumstances, I would suggest the Reclaimer simply remove the index."
"Weapons of last resort, built by the Forerunners to eliminate potential Flood hosts, thereby rendering the parasite harmless."
Assault.
Ball taken.
Betrayal!
Betrayed!
Bomb armed! Bomb planted!
Bomb dropped!
Bomb returned!
Capture the flag.
Defense.
Double kill!
Flag captured.
Flag returned!
Gained the lead.
Game over.
Hill contested!
Hill controlled!
Hill moved.
In the zone!
Juggernaut.
Killfrenzy.
Killimanjaro.
Killtacular!
Killtrocity!
King of the hill.
Lost the lead!
Are my guards too much for you?
"Every member of the Covenant shall walk the path; none will be left behind when our Great Journey begins! That is the Prophets' age-old promise, and it shall be fulfilled! Great Journey? Doesn't he know what these rings do?"
Fool! You've made yourself an easy target.
Guards! Remove this vermin from my sight.
"Here I am, human - slay me if you can!"
Human filth! You foul this holy place.
"I shall light this holy ring, release its cleansing flame, and burn a path into the divine beyond!"
"In a gesture of peace and reconciliation, the Prophets promised to find the means of the Forerunners' transcendence, and to share this knowledge with the Elites. The Elites promised to defend the Prophets as they searched. A simple arrangement... that has become our binding Covenant. Transcendence, huh? More like mass suicide."
Incompetents! I'll kill it myself!
"Most of those we encountered on our search were compelled to join our union, to take part in a movement that promised freedom for allegiance, salvation for service! But some, like the humans, chose to impede our progress, block our access to sacred sites, damage holy relics! For their transgressions, the humans shall be hunted until none remain alive!"
Surely you can do better than that!
"The Forerunners, our most exalted lords, used the seven sacred rings to flee a doomed existence, to escape their endless struggle against the flood. Long ago, the Prophets and Elites fought an equally fruitless war. Indeed, I suspect we would still be at each other's throats had the Prophets not found evidence of the Forerunners and their Great Journey."
The Great Journey will not be postponed!
This is the human's greatest warrior? Hahahahaha!
Warriors! Attack! The demon must die!
Why anyone would fear this 'demon' is beyond me.
You dare to interrupt my sermon?
"You shall not hide from me, Demon."
"Your very existence offends me, Demon!"
[Regret death sounds]
A little confusing... but effective.
Affirmative.
Aim... somewhere else!
All set!
All your dogs are not barkin' at the same tree.
All's clear.
Almost funny... try again!
"Always liked you, Chief. Always liked you!"
And to think I volunteered for this.
"And what, pray tell, am I supposed to do with this?"
Another alien! Over there!
Any time!
Are we finished?
"Are you mentally handicapped, sir?"
Are you TRYING to make me angry?
"As long as we standin' here, might as well write my old lady."
"Aside from all this nasty stuff whizzing past my head, I'm fine."
"Aw, poor thing!"
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do? You're gonna get the crap kicked outta ya - that's what you're gonna do.
Boogey-man at one o'clock!
"Check your target, sir!"
Chief - feel free to get in on this.
"Chief, I thought we was like, partners, and whatnot."
"Chief, we go back, you know... like flapjacks and collard greens."
"Chief, you may be the dumbest best man I've ever met."
Aim more carefully!
"All right, then - I'll show you how it's done."
Arbiter - speak your mind.
Arbiter - you give me no choice!
Arbiter! What are you doing?
Arbiter... you have my thanks.
"Careful, Arbiter!"
Charge the enemy!
"Come out, so we may kill you!"
"Come, Arbiter - what foolishness is this?"
"Control yourself, Arbiter!"
Fair enough!
Follow me to victory!
Good.
Have your brains leaked from your skull?
He's using a holodrone - he must be close.
Here I am!
I have it right here!
I stand ready.
I stare at you - you stare at me. I fail to see the point.
"I welcome that, and more!"
"I wonder who the sniper will shoot first... you, or me."
I'll assume that was an accident!
I'll put it to good use!
"I'm in your debt, Arbiter."
'Least you breathed. I was worried.
A plan is a beautiful thing when it works. This was a beautiful thing.
A victory ain't the war... but it sure tastes good.
A-hole!
"According to the manual, you're a jackass!"
"After I bury them, I'm gonna bury you."
Ah - some days it don't pay to get out of bed!
"Ah, it's long gone - no heat!"
"Ah, save it for the next one."
Ain't nothin' permanent.
All right - I need help!
All right - let's get medieval on their ass!
All right - let's keep it wired tight! This ain't a party!
"All right - let's make 'em see-through, people!"
All right - not all of 'em are gonna be this easy.
All right - vehicle destroyed!
All right - zip it!
"All right people, let's keep it wired tight."
All right! Saddle up! We're movin' out!
"All right, gentlemen - let's get freaky!"
"All right, I admit it... ooh, that hurt."
"All right, let's buckle up."
"All right, let's load up the butcher shop, people!"
"All right, let's not get happy."
"All right, let's rock and roll, people."
Dawa ya moto ni moto.

A staring contest? I never lose.
Are you looking at my ass?
Bullets do not grow on perennial woody plants.
"Can I help you, Reclaimer?"
Direct your fire elsewhere!
Do you mind?
Do you think bullets grow on trees?
"I am not the enemy, Reclaimer."
I don't blink.
I'm quite impervious.
I've got you in my crosshairs.
Is my hat on crooked?
"Is there some problem, Reclaimer?"
Is there something in my eye?
May I be of some assistance to you?
May I be of some assistance?
"Must you, really?"
My ideas never stop coming.
MY shields don't deplete.
"Oddly enough, it sounds as if I have a tongue."
Oh! You're a klutz.
"Oh, I see - you're a moron!"
"Oh, I see... you're clumsy."
Please - do try to be more careful.
"Please, desist."
Be careful!
Do you require aid?
I am ready to fight.
I'm prepared for war.
Save your anger for our true foes!
Unworthy of my blades.
What do you mean?
What is it you want?
"Yes, what is it?"
Yes?
You dare challenge me?
You should not try my patience.
"A gift, for you!"
Advance! A sniper - find cover!
After it! It cannot escape!
Ahhh - it's a good day!
Away!
Bastard!
Change your panties and flush it out!
Come and fight me!
Cover me! you're covered!
Cowardly traitor!
"Damn you, you bastard!"
Demon - your life is forfeit.
"Die, traitor!"
"Don't break ranks, pack brothers!"
Everyone - grenades!
Found him!
He may be nearby - stay alert!
He was my lover!
Here it is!
I am wounded - I bleed!
I had him - he's in cover.
I hate you!
I have found my dinner!
I smelled it out!
I would drink your blood!
I'm losing it! I just wanna be home!
I'm scared - and there's nothing I can do to help!
We still have geothermal power to some of these facilities.
A fearsome weapon!
"A fine battle, don't you think?"
Aahh huh?
Advance!
Aha! I destroyed that one!
Aieee!
Aiiee!
"Another day, another victory!"
Are they done?
Are you blind?
Are you ill?
Can I assist you with something?
Can you not see?
Come on... really!
Did you think to best an elite?
Didn't I give you this for Christmas?
Do I look like an Unggoy?
Do you want something?
"Don't be a fool, reclaimer!"
Don't point that thing at me!
Don't you have more pressing matters to attend to?
"Focus your rage on the prophets, and their lackeys!"
Follow his lead!
Foolish wretch!
He is dead.
Are you looking at me because I'm pretty... or because you enjoy being slapped?
But I just found the sweet spot on that one!
"Cool your jets, buddy. You're not my type."
"Could you, um... stop it?"
"Could you, um... STOP IT?"
Did you see me kick that guy's ass?
"Dude, stop staring. There's no party going on in my pants."
"Gosh - let's be friends forever! K, thanks, bye!"
Hahaha - I wish they all were that easy.
"Hey - if you're just gonna stand there, why don't you go get me some whiskey?"
"Hey - keep your eyes in the green zone, soldier!"
Hey - you awake in that helmet?
"Hey soldier - reserve the PDA for your momma, huh?"
Hey! Now I got brains on my face!
Hey! Why don't you just take my pants while you're at it?
"Hey! You're making me uncomfortable, okay?"
Hey... I've got an idea... let's go shoot some aliens!
How long were you in cryo?
"I am not THAT good-looking, okay?"
I don't have the body armor for one more of those.
I guess I should be glad that you didn't kill me.
I have pictures on MySpace. Go check those out!
"I know, right? I look cute in this!"
I'm gonna stomp a mudhole in your ass!
I'm revved up and ready to rock.
I shall rise again.
Let us begin
A holy flare to light the journey!
Ah - we're doomed!
"Ah, no, he's not here!"
Air-sucking windbag fleshy!
Always in the last place you look.
"At this point, if the Demon kill us... we deserve it."
Attack!
Bad guy!
Bad guy! Twelve o'clock!
Big bastard!
Bullying heretic!
By your command!
Come back when you're ready to fight!
Comin' for ya!
"Darn, he got away!"
Death from the sky!
Death is coming.
"Demon, you're weak!"
Don't irritate the demon!
Don't just stand there cowering... fight!
Don't kill me!
Don't make him any angrier!
Don't make the demon angry!
Don't run after him - it's got germs.
Don't worry! I'll get him!
...the gorram-hell do I do with this?
A-ow - my freakin' buttcheek!
Advance - on the double!
"Ah, relax, relax. That one will have a heart attack, in about a minute."
"Ah, that was just an hors d'oeuvres - bring on the steak!"
"Ah, we'll get him later."
"Ah, you're doing just shiny!"
"All right, officially, now, you're stalking me."
"All right, Waldo - I've found you."
All right... and now it's officially creepy.
Am I still alive? Really? It's just... I can't tell.
"And, uh... and so we basically keep doing this until there are none of them left, huh?"
Another victory for ODST superiority!
Anyone home? No? Good.
"Anything I can do, Chief?"
"Are we gonna have some kind of problem, Creepy?"
"Are we playing the silent game cause I'm not good at that game! Oh! I - ah, I lost."
"Are you checking to see if I have a Flood infection? Because I don't, it's... eczema."
Are you trying to hypnotize me or something?
Assface!
"Aw, c'mon, guys!"
"Aw, great - there's more!"
"Aw, I'm gonna take some heads with this!"
Bastard!
Beats my standard-issue noisemaker!
" The Chief! Oh, crikey, now what do we do?"
"Ah, yeah. Great stuff!"
"C'mon, guys!"
"Crikey - what are you, a bunch of schoolgirls? Hahaha - Girl Scouts!"
Grenade!
"Hey - take a picture, it lasts longer."
"Hey, nice throw!"
Let's motivate!
Oh - thank god you're here!
"What are ya, a bunch of schoolgirls?"
"Wow, we just basically reamed 'em, huh?"
Assault!
Capture the flag.
Game over!
Hill moved.
Infected!
Juggernaut.
King of the hill.
New juggernaut.
New VIP.
Oddball.
Play ball!
Slayer.
Territories.
'Bout time I had the upper hand!
A plan would be good.
"Ah, nice pause, but um... this war ain't gonna fight itself."
Are you waiting for me to do something?
"Boy, I just love getting up in the morning and kicking somebody's ass."
"Boy, the uglier they are, the harder they fall."
C'mon - let's light this candle.
"C'mon, let's do this thing!"
"Can we get our act together, before we, you know, do that again?"
Can you hit anything with this?
"Chief, there's nothing happening here now."
Did you go somewhere? And why didn't you bring back two?
"Didn't work so good for you, why would I want it?"
"Does it look like I'm complaining, sir?"
"Don't ask, don't tell."
"Hey, any time you want this back... too bad!"
"Hey, Chief - thanks."
I better not find that laying around somewhere!
I do not like the idea of dying. Just wanna let you know.
I guess it's yours now!
I guess you know what you're doing.
"I know I'm quite a sight, but do your looking later!"
I love takin' down brutes.
"I thought I was gonna buy the farm back there, I did I did I did..."
"I'm in your debt, sir."

"All right, Waldo - I've found you."
All right... and now it's officially creepy.
Am I still alive? Really? It's just... I can't tell.
"And, uh... and so we basically keep doing this until there are none of them left, huh?"
Another victory for ODST superiority!
Anyone home? No? Good.
"Anything I can do, Chief?"
"Are we gonna have some kind of problem, Creepy?"
"Are we playing the silent game cause I'm not good at that game! Oh! I - ah, I lost."
"Are you checking to see if I have a Flood infection? Because I don't, it's... eczema."
Are you trying to hypnotize me or something?
Assface!
"Aw, c'mon, guys!"
"Aw, great - there's more!"
"Aw, I'm gonna take some heads with this!"
Bastard!
Beats my standard-issue noisemaker!
" The Chief! Oh, crikey, now what do we do?"
"Ah, yeah. Great stuff!"
"C'mon, guys!"
"Crikey - what are you, a bunch of schoolgirls? Hahaha - Girl Scouts!"
Grenade!
"Hey - take a picture, it lasts longer."
"Hey, nice throw!"
Let's motivate!
Oh - thank god you're here!
"What are ya, a bunch of schoolgirls?"
"Wow, we just basically reamed 'em, huh?"
Assault!
Capture the flag.
Game over!
Hill moved.
Infected!
Juggernaut.
King of the hill.
New juggernaut.
New VIP.
Oddball.
Play ball!
Slayer.
Territories.
'Bout time I had the upper hand!
A plan would be good.
"Ah, nice pause, but um... this war ain't gonna fight itself."
Are you waiting for me to do something?
"Boy, I just love getting up in the morning and kicking somebody's ass."
"Boy, the uglier they are, the harder they fall."
C'mon - let's light this candle.
"C'mon, let's do this thing!"
"Can we get our act together, before we, you know, do that again?"
Can you hit anything with this?
"Chief, there's nothing happening here now."
Did you go somewhere? And why didn't you bring back two?
"Didn't work so good for you, why would I want it?"
"Does it look like I'm complaining, sir?"
"Don't ask, don't tell."
"Hey, any time you want this back... too bad!"
"Hey, Chief - thanks."
I better not find that laying around somewhere!
I do not like the idea of dying. Just wanna let you know.
I guess it's yours now!
I guess you know what you're doing.
"I know I'm quite a sight, but do your looking later!"
I love takin' down brutes.
"I thought I was gonna buy the farm back there, I did I did I did..."
"I'm in your debt, sir."
Chief - Look out! I don't think this is going to end well...
d. We'll be on station if you need us. Make sure you give the Didact our regards. Infinity out.
Clean hit. We're proceeding to insertion.
Approaching the Didact's ship in two hundred kilometers! Once we get onboard, we'll find the bridge.
He's on the move again.
It's not over. Not yet.
They'll pair you with another AI. Maybe even another Cortana model if Halsey lets them.
They're not responding!
Cortana, can you access the station's defense systems?
Tap the flight deck. Find us something that can carry a payload.
They've compromised the station's hull.
I'll make sure the nukes are primes so you can detonate them remotely. Maybe next time you rescue us, you can give us more time to pack?
Inventory lists seven excavation grade Havok mines. Just one of those would turn this base into a piñata.
Can you give Cortana access to the station's supply manifest?
We don't have any choice, Doctor.
It's not a matter of choice. It took three months and the biggest starship the UNSC could throw at it just to relocate it here. Unless you're a lot stronger than you look, it's not going anywhere.
I desperately hope you know why all this is happening. Because, to be honest, my objectivity isn't doing me a whole lot of good right now. Hold on, I'll start us down.
I'm your greatest achievement and you detest me.
Cortana!
Yes, well he also said he works better alone. I can see why you chose him, Catherine.
Yes! I read you! This is Sandy Tillson of Ivanoff Station! We're under attack!
Because the Composer's not ON the ring. What are you waiting for? That station's not going to save itself.
A Halo?
Installation 03. It's where Infinity found the coordinates to Requiem.
They're jumping into slipspace. Get below deck!
Cortana, what's happening?
I don't know. Hang on!
C'mon, Chief. Take a girl for a ride.
And, Chief? Good luck. Both of you.
I can give you over forty thousand reasons why I know that sun isn't real.
Get word to Earth that trouble is coming. Cortana and I will do what we can back here.
ARREST HIM!
I am ordering you to surrender that AI!
Commander Lasky, Pursuant to Article 55 of UNSC Regulation 12-145-72. I am ordering you to remove that AI's data chip and retire it for final dispensation.
And with all due respect to you, Soldier, I'm not willing to jeopardize my ship because of the hallucinations of an aging Spartan and his malfunctioning AI.
Sir, we've seen what the Didact is capable of. If we let him leave this world, humanity will be at risk.
Infinity cannot handle that kind of punishment, not again!
Reclaimer! The genesong I placed within you contains many gifts, including an immunity to the Composer. But it must be unlocked!
I don't know about you, but I usually like a little more 'intel' with my intel
Sir, Infinity drove the Didact back. He's vulnerable.
We've never seen this type of offensive reaction from any of the other installations.
I don't know if it's too soon to ask you for a favor but we're going to run out of breathing room here real quick. I don't suppose you're any good at clearing LZs?
Seal 'er up. Thought you'd be taller.
This is Sierra 117 of the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn. We're on station, ready to assist.
Infinity! This is Sierra 117 of the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn. Do you copy?
That's the kicker. It's the Forerunner symbol for 'Reclaimer'.
When all hopes are lost, only then does reality acquire that sharp focus that defines who we are and what we have become.
It is no crime. I once felt affection for a Warrior-Servant as I hunted his ships and destroyed his fighters. No lover ever felt my attentions so fiercely.
We laid waste their fleets, attacked their outpost worlds.… And the Forerunners themselves found a way to bring down the indestructible architecture of the Precursors, on Charum Hakkor.… Charum Hakkor, once called the Eternal.
They start again as children—all together. It is what the Composer was designed to prevent.
Can the Flood choose to infect, or not to infect?
All that I was, but for reflections in a cracked mirror, has been lost for a long, long time.
What I could not understand was why the Didact had decided to save one of those very weapons whose creation he had so decisively opposed.
All dreams are young, my host, my friend. All dreams belong to youth, whether they be nightmares or idylls.
The horizon curved upward to both sides. Not good, not right. Horizons do not curve up.
We shouldn’t cross this place,” I said. “A bad, sad place. It doesn’t know it’s dead.
4 of us, and 2000 of them. Piss-poor odds. For them.
Honer and self sacrifice. Death does not diminish these qualities in a soldier. We shall remember.
A leader must be ready to send the soldiers under his command to their deaths.
I AM MENDICANT BIAS THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE
I can picture you in your garden, surveying all you have created--surveying all you have preserved. And I curse the circumstance that keeps my finger on the trigger.
Of all the fates to befall us, this is the cruelest of all. My inaction and hesitation kept me here, on the wrong side of the line. And [300 years[?]] of our society's failure and miscalculation makes me your executioner.
//ERROR--NO CARRIER OR RECEIPT AVAILABLE
>NO. THERE IS MORE. BUT YOU ARE NOT WORTHY. NOT YET.
You don't know the contortions I had to go through to follow you here, Reclaimer. I know what you're here for. What position do I take? Will I follow one betrayal with another?
How many of these have you found?
Wait, what's that?
But I would have my masters know that I have changed. And you shall be my example.
And so here at the end of my life, I do once again betray a former master. The path ahead is fraught with peril. But I will do all I can to keep it stable - keep you safe.
Isn't sacrifice in the interest of others what you always spoke of as being so noble? Should I have allowed another to bloody his hands while I remained safe behind a [shield of privilege]?
We have no time to spare, Didact. Every vessel we can fill, we send to the Ark. I dare not cease the mission. Not now, not until I’ve done all I can. Each one of these souls is finite and precious.
Despite this the morale of my charges remains high. They wake, clean themselves, fuel their bodies, communicate with one another, eliminate waste, train to destroy the enemy, and return to sleep.
The sacrifices they have chosen to make on the behalf of their [brethren] fills me with pride.
If only I could save them all - but they know, perhaps even better than I, that that is not possible.
Is this the noble sacrifice my creators spoke of? Where is the nobility in these streets paved with greasy carbon and dun ash? [My mouth is speaking at another’s behest] - that is not my voice; that is the other.
When engaged, the enemy commits every non-supraluminal craft with no appreciable pattern or strategy beyond making physical contact. Conversely, all supraluminal craft leave on seemingly random trajectories.
I’m close to finishing the task. The indexing and the archival processes are as complete as I can hope for. If we wait longer, we risk catastrophe. The thing has already destroyed every colony on my side of the line.
Please. Activate the Array.
The Mantle. You still hold to that [fairy tale] after all that has happened? After this thing has consumed a million worlds?
Can’t you see? Belief in the Mantle sealed our doom! Weakened our [protectorates], bred dependence and sloth. Our [so-called Guardianship] has stripped those we would keep safe of any capacity for self-defense!
There are no unstoppable forces in this universe. There are no immovable objects. Everything gives if you push hard enough.
The Mantle has not failed! I’ve already razed scores of worlds - sterilized systems, routed and [disintegrated] the parasite! We’re learning its tricks and strategies. We can halt this thing! And we can follow in Their footsteps!
And what about us, Didact? We’ve been irresistible and immovable for too long.
It seems that I’ll never truly understand my creators. But how {~} that you speak of is one of {~} rejected so violently?

How formal of you, Librarian. We're receiving shipments of indexed beings more frequently that communications. Don't compound scarcity with brevity.
I know things beyond the [Maginot] line are harried. But I worry about you. I've asked you time and time again. Abandon your cataloging.
I certainly can't justify using the [transit measure] to save my own skin when there are still so many innocents to protect and index.
We have no time to spare, Didact. Every vessel we can fill, we send to the Ark. I dare not cease the mission. Not now, not until I've done all I can.
[29,478 hours] have passed since I left the [Maginot] sphere and entered contested space.
If only I could save them all - but they know, perhaps even better than I, that that is not possible.
[37 seconds] ago I moved beyond my ability to observe the events taking place on [CE-10-2165-d].
The importance of my mission forbade me from rendering any aid, but no less important was the need for me to study the enemy's capabilities in real world situations.
Despite the fact that the naval garrison was aware of the likelihood of just such an attack, their ability to effectively defend against it proved insufficient.
Its voice stands out as the single calm note in the panicked cacophony outside the sphere. It alone is not decrying its fate or raging against the [central government].
When engaged, the enemy commits every non-supraluminal craft with no appreciable pattern or strategy beyond making physical contact.
Conversely, all supraluminal craft leave on seemingly random trajectories.
I understand the goal of this mission but time--our least abundant resource--is wasted every time we do a system-wide scan for survivors.
I'm close to finishing the task. The indexing and the archival processes are as complete as I can hope for. If we wait longer, we risk catastrophe.
No. Activation is murder. A genocide larger than [this galaxy] has ever known. We are sworn to protect life not destroy it! That is the Mantle we were given to carry.

And what about us, Didact? We've been irresistible and immovable for too long. Maybe it's our turn to give.

MB.05-032.> In either circumstance I certainly am equipped for it, aren't I? But you're right; a peaceful solution to this dilemma would be preferable.
Perhaps there is a way to accomplish your mission without violence? Why put the lives of those on your ships at risk if there is no need?

//FRAGMENT 3/7 [RECORDED VERBATIM AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]
We have the answer. We've built Mendicant Bias. It's a contender-class [AI] unlike anything we've ever achieved.
And we've observed a pattern it can exploit.
The parasite has formed a Compound Mind. When it reaches a certain mass, the Mind is able to recoil its disparate parts to create a [tactical shield].
This is a simple matter of mass preservation. The thing has no compunction about sacrificing parts of the whole.
But when the core of the Mind is threatened, it reacts violently and quickly.
If we are to defeat it, the trick will be coordinating our forays against the [sprawling infection] with Mendicant Bias assaults the Mind's core.
This is the only time we see it retract or slow its growth.
So far, we've been hesitant to use certain weapons because of the damage they cause surviving populations and environments.
That protocol has been abandoned.
Mendicant Bias will draw the Mind into battle outside the line, dealing with local biomass and other parts as best he can.
The scale of the problem is vast, but the strategy is sound.
It will require patience, materiel and an investment of energy unlike anything we have ever considered.
It's a dangerous plan that carries more risk than the Array, but I believe it can work. Even if we simply force it to retreat--to retract--that will at least give us some respite.
Some time to muster more resources...
Some time to rescue you.
Are you insane? Would you risk every life in the galaxy for this transparently futile plan? Have you learned nothing in these last [300 years[?]]?
The thing will laugh at your efforts!
Do not let your concern for my welfare commit you to this suicidal scheme!
REPORT: SECURITY BREACH 1/3 Heuristic pathology; [alpha site] experienced an impermanent containment failure event on [spurious_data/se_ref.[?]].
The suspect data barrier interchange anomaly was detected precisely [.409 seconds] after its appearance.
The epicenter of the disturbance is the partition currently housing a [personality construct array] retrieved from Contender AI 05-032. <+> 0816.
REPORT: SECURITY BREACH 2/3 Although [adjacent] systems reacted to the disturbance withing expected parameters, a more comprehensive investigation was undertaken.

L: Something is wrong! It's moving away! At night I can see it--flitting shadows--black against the stars. Thousands of ships! Not spiraling outward, but heading for the line!
This is the tipping point, Didact. It's no longer feeding.
L: I've remotely destroyed our Keyships. A security measure. Without them I cannot reach the Ark. But neither then can the thing.
I'm trapped. On a beautiful, empty world. Its inhabitants have been safely indexed, every single one of them. They're special--well worth the effort it took to build one final gateway even at this late hour.
This may be our last communication. I'm begging you. Fire the Array. Light the weapon, and let it be done.
D: We've confirmed your observations. Infected supraluminal ships are arrowing inward from several clusters. No more spiral growth.
The thing is counterattacking. Suppression, Security and Emergency Circumstance fleets are all being recalled. Systems are evacuating.
Mendicant Bias is no longer communicating with us.
But now I can guess where you are.
MB.05-032.> It is overwhelmingly clear that my creators have chosen to ignore destiny calling to them [from the threshold] {~} have come face-to-face with the inevitable action of self replicating chemical processes and have {~} deciding whether to embrace their face or deny it completely.
LF.Xx.3273.> Perhaps they have found {~} of making that decision for themselves? Perhaps they chose to leave it {~} impartial outsider; cast your as and arbiter during this time of great need?
MB.05-032.> I was created to study you as if you were some problem to be solved. And I have done so {~} [379,807 hours]. If they wished they could have made a decision based on that data alone.
But as you are the next stage in the evolution of the universe, who am I - or my creators - to obstruct your progress?
LF.Xx.3273.> Elucidate.
MB.05-032.> {~} choose to remain beholden to ancient myths {~} does not matter where they claim their authority originates {~} obstructs the path of universal evolution and must be removed.
No matter how well intentioned, their obstinacy in the face of the inevitable progression of nature can no longer be tolerated.
My creators have been [an immovable object] for too long.
MB.05-032.> Thus I have chosen to commit my sizable resources to what is, for all intents and purposes, [the proverbial irresistible force].
All that I have is now yours to do with as you see fit.
Considering the enemy intelligence's raw [computing power], the Keyships' strategy will only remain viable for another [657,000 hours] and this current stalemate has the potential to last considerably longer than that.
With my understanding of the enemy's [modus operandi], its logical boundaries, and [catalog of witness] I have devised what I believe is our most sound fall-back strategy.
By [cutting fire breaks[?]] into the [core worlds' volume] we would be able to frustrate the enemy's advances for approximately [70,080 hours] and lure them into costly naval battles.
While the its resources on the ground are effectively limitless, it has a finite number of vessels of spread from system to system.
Fortunately the majority of them are unarmed and unarmored, private and commercial craft.
According to legend, Path Kethona was first visited by Forerunners during our greatest period of exploration, over ten million years ago.
Not even Haruspis, entrusted with studying the Domain, could access those memories.
Stars I understand. They shed light and give life. It is the emptiness between that haunts me.
Humans believe in nothingness, in zeros. It is one of their distinguishing traits. They keep inventing nothing. Forerunners know otherwise.
"“It’s out there,” Bitterness says. “Your monster. Mendicant Bias. Can’t you feel it?”"
I now understand why humans smile. Forerunners have done all they can to banish smiles. Not all smiles are about greetings and joy. Some smile in shared pain.
If the Domain is destroyed, I have condemned my husband to an eternity of darkness, silence, with only his own rage and madness to keep him company.
But ingenuity is often indistinguishable from foolish play, and foolish play is one of those traits I find most endearing about humanity.
The asteroids interfere with the collapsing function of each emerging ship; in effect, either forcing them to abandon the transit, or to combine asteroid mass with the ship’s.
Only the threat of the Flood itself could have forced me back from utterly extirpating humanity.
